# 🚀 My Developer Journey – From Cyber to Code
Started with static HTML in the 90s. After other adventures, I’m back — now building full stack.


Hi there! 👋 I’m Anthony, a current student in the **University of Pennsylvania's MCIT (Master of Computer and Information Technology)** program and a lifelong builder who’s come full circle back to software development.

### 🕹️ My Origin Story
I first touched HTML in the 90s on Angelfire as a 13-year-old — back when AOL was king and building web pages meant raw code and curiosity. Even though my career path led me through cybersecurity and technical roles, I never lost that spark for building.

### 🧠 My Mission
Now I’m diving back into software development headfirst, combining my analytical and security background with a full-stack focus. This repo tracks my journey as I re-skill, upskill, and ship real software — all while leveraging my education from UPenn’s MCIT program.
